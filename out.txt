%description
The Boost web site provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source
libraries.  The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
already been included in the C++ 2011 standard and others have been
proposed to the C++ Standards Committee for inclusion in future
standards.

Although Boost was begun by members of the C++ Standards Committee
Library Working Group, membership has expanded to include nearly two
thousand members of the C++ community at large.

%package asio-devel
Summary: The Boost Asio Library development files
Group: Development/C++
BuildArch: noarch
AutoReq: yes, nocpp

Requires(pre,postun): boost-devel = 1:1.80.0-alt3

Requires: boost-context-devel = 1:1.80.0-alt3

Requires: boost-coroutine-devel = 1:1.80.0-alt3



%description asio-devel
asio is a cross-platform C++ library for network programming that
provides developers with a consistent asynchronous I/O model using a
modern C++ approach.


%package context-devel
Summary: The Boost Context Library development files
Group: Development/C++
AutoReq: yes, nocpp

Requires(pre,postun): boost-devel = 1:1.80.0-alt3
Requires: libboost_context1.80.0 = 1:1.80.0-alt3

%description context-devel
Boost.Context is a foundational library that provides a sort of
cooperative multitasking on a single thread. By providing an abstraction
of the current execution state in the current thread, including the
stack (with local variables) and stack pointer, all registers and CPU
flags, and the instruction pointer, a fcontext_t instance represents a
specific point in the application's execution path. This is useful for
building higher-level abstractions, like coroutines, cooperative threads
(userland threads) or an equivalent to C# keyword yield in C++.


%package coroutine-devel
Summary: The Boost Coroutine Library development files
Group: Development/C++
AutoReq: yes, nocpp

Requires(pre,postun): boost-devel = 1:1.80.0-alt3
Requires: boost-context-devel = 1:1.80.0-alt3
Requires: libboost_coroutine1.80.0 = 1:1.80.0-alt3

%description coroutine-devel
Boost.Coroutine provides templates for generalized subroutines which
allow multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at
certain locations. It preserves the local state of execution and allows
re-entering subroutines more than once (useful if state must be kept
across function calls).

In contrast to threads, which are pre-emptive, coroutine switches are
cooperative (programmer controls when a switch will happen). The kernel
is not involved in the coroutine switches.

The implementation uses Boost.Context for context switching.


%package filesystem-devel
Summary: The Boost Filesystem Library development files
Group: Development/C++
AutoReq: yes, nocpp

Requires(pre,postun): boost-devel = 1:1.80.0-alt3

manipulate paths, files, and directories.


%package flyweight-devel

AutoReq: yes, nocpp

Requires(pre,postun): boost-devel = 1:1.80.0-alt3
Requires: boost-interprocess-devel = 1:1.80.0-alt3

%description flyweight-devel
Flyweights are small-sized handle classes granting constant access to
shared common data, thus allowing for the management of large amounts of
entities within reasonable memory limits. Boost.Flyweight makes it easy
to use this common programming idiom by providing the class template
flyweight<T>, which acts as a drop-in replacement for const T.

It is header-only library. This package contains the headers.


%package geometry-devel

Boost.Geometry, defines concepts, primitives and algorithms for solving
geometry problems. It Boost.Geometry contains a dimension-agnostic,
coordinate-system-agnostic and scalable kernel, based on concepts,
meta-functions and tag dispatching. On top of that kernel, algorithms
are built.

Boost.Geometry contains instantiable geometry classes, but library
users can also use their own. Using registration macros or traits
classes their geometries can be adapted to fulfil Boost.Geometry
concepts.

%description -n libboost_atomic1.80.0
Boost.Atomic is a library that provides atomic data types and operations
on these data types, as well as memory ordering constraints required for
coordinating multiple threads through atomic variables. It implements

Boost.Chrono more generally useful, the library provides a number
of clocks that are thin wrappers around the operating system's process
time API, thereby allowing the extraction of wall clock time,
user CPU time, and system CPU time of the process.

%description -n libboost_coroutine1.80.0
Boost.Coroutine provides templates for generalized subroutines which
allow suspending and resuming execution at certain locations. It
preserves the local state of execution and allows re-entering
subroutines more than once.

Coroutines can be viewed as a language-level construct providing a
special kind of control flow. In contrast to threads, which are
pre-emptive, coroutine switches are cooperative (programmer controls
when a switch will happen). The kernel is not involved in the coroutine
switches. The implementation uses Boost.Context for context switching.


%package -n libboost_date_time1.80.0

Group: Development/C++
Provides: boost-datetime = 1:1.80.0-alt3

%description -n libboost_date_time1.80.0
Programming  with  dates  and  times  should  be  almost as simple and
natural  as  programming  with strings and integers. Applications with
lots  of temporal logic can be radically simplified by having a robust
set  of operators and calculation capabilities. Classes should provide
the ability to compare dates and times, add lengths or time durations,
retrieve dates and times from clocks, and work naturally with date and
time intervals.

Provides: boost-regex-gcc3 = 1:1.80.0-alt3
Provides: boost-regex = 1:1.80.0-alt3

%description -n libboost_regex1.80.0
Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often used
in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix utilities
grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each of which make
extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++ users have been
limited to the POSIX C API's for manipulating regular expressions, and
while regex++ does provide these API's, they do not represent the best
way to use the library. For example regex++ can cope with wide character
strings, or search and replace operations (in a manner analogous to
either sed or perl), something that traditional C libraries can not do.


%package -n libboost_serialization1.80.0
Summary: The Boost Serialization Library (Boost.Serialization)
Group: Development/C++

%description -n libboost_serialization1.80.0
Here, we use the term "serialization" to mean the reversible
deconstruction of an arbitrary set of C++ data structures to a sequence
of bytes. Such a system can be used to reconstitute an equivalent
structure in another program context.  Depending on this context, this
might used implement object persistence, remote parameter passing or
other facility.  In this system we use the term "archive" to refer to a
specific rendering of this stream of bytes. This could be a file of
binary data, text data, XML, or some other created by the user of this
library.

execute as multiple threads are called multi-threaded programs to
distinguish them from traditional single-threaded programs. Definitions

environment.
